email suggestions, comments to mike@semtechinteractive.com

***due to the large number of sites now using this script, I will no longer be able to
   provide free support. If you want specific features added, contact me for a special
   price. Don't spend weeks trying to add features and integrate it into your existing
   portal site or web site. I can take care of the coding and customization and even
   adding a few more features in a day or 2 for normally around $100(US). If you find
   that you need more added to meet your needs than what is available in the free version,
   please support me by letting me do the work: mike@semtechinteractive.com

New features added in version 1.1:

-Sound plays when message is received (thanks for the suggestion, Al)
 to change sound simply edit html in display_message.asp <bgsound src="...">
-Corrected logout issue which sometimes caused users to remain online even after they
 logged out.
